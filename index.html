          <p>
            I was born in Paris, Mississippi, Feburary 3rd, 2000. I'm attending
            Base Camp Coding Academy as a GI student, software Developer in
            training. I'm extremely creative and artistic, hard working and very
            driven to get work done! On side of coding, I love creating art and
            playing video games, I one day hope to create a fully functioning
            video game to educate children in a fun and creative way using art
            and animation I plan to create myself!

          <h4>Skills</h4>
          <p>
            Being a student at BCCA, I have learned Python, HTML and CSS. In the
            future I plan on learning as many other languages as I can. I am
            good with time management on behalf of always being on time in my
            past work days and even when attending BCCA, however when moments
            arise when I'm not able to come I will warn of my absence ahead of
            time. Not only does BCCA help me learn new languages, it's helped me
            with my commication skills and leadership skills. I've greatly
            improved since being here. I've worked on a management team, and now
            currently I occupy a spot in the documentation team.

          <h5>Projects</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="last">
          I've created several projects while attending BCCA, two websites to
          get started into HTML and CSS. Created a cookbook program where you
          could flip through all recipes and decide which ones you'd like to
          cook. Once you're done selecting, the program will create a file
          containing all ingredients needed to create the recipe and the steps
          needed to create it. All that can be accessed on my Github, I plan on
          uploading more projects in the future, including this one.
