          <p>
            I was born in Paris, Mississippi. I'm attending Base Camp Coding
            Academy as a Graduate Institute student, software Developer in
            training. I'm extremely creative and artistic, hard working and very
            driven to get work done! On the side of coding, I love creating art
            and playing video games, one day I hope to create a fully functional
            video game to educate children in a fun and creative way using art
            and animation I create personally!
          </p>
          <h4>Skills</h4>
          <p>
            Being a student at BCCA, I have learned Python, HTML and CSS. In the
            future I plan on learning as many other languages as I can. I am
            gifted with time management and communication skills. Not only has
            BCCA help me learn new languages, it's helped me sharpen my
            communication and leadership skills. I've greatly improved since
            being here. I've worked on a management team, and now currently I
            occupy a spot in the documentation team.
          </p>
          <h5>Projects</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="last">
          I've created several projects while attending BCCA, two websites to
          get started into HTML and CSS. Created a cookbook program where you
          could flip through all recipes and decide which ones you'd like to
          cook. Once you're done selecting, the program will create a file
          containing all ingredients needed to create the recipe and the steps
          needed to create it. All that can be accessed on my Github, I plan on
          uploading more projects in the future, including this one.
